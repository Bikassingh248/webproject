            <p>In the late 13th century, the Mongol empire has laid waste to entire nations along their campaign to
                conquer the East. Tsushima Island is all that stands between mainland Japan and a massive Mongol
                invasion fleet led by the ruthless and cunning general, Khotun Khan.</p>
            <p>As the island burns in the wake of the first wave of the Mongol assault, courageous samurai warrior Jin
                Sakai stands resolute. As one of the last surviving members of his clan, Jin is resolved to do whatever
                it takes, at any cost, to protect his people and reclaim his home. He must set aside the traditions that
                have shaped him as a warrior to forge a new path, the path of the Ghost, and wage an unconventional war
                for the freedom of Tsushima.</p>
